        <p>Dear you,</p>
        <div style="display: flex; gap: 2rem;">
            <p style="text-align: justify; display: block; width: 33%;">
                The Potabi projects are on a temporary hiatus until further notice.
                I have been dealing with a lot of crap in my personal life, and I
                simply just don't have the will to work on this project at the
                moment. I do plan to return to the project sometime soon-ish, however,
                with everything going on like courts, and worrying about everything, 
                it's been too much. If you want to support me, I have written a book
                called "Technology Sucks", and am working on another book in my free
                time to help pass time.
                <br><br>
                For those who don't know what I have been going through, I have caught
                a felony case. Since I am still dealing with the courts, I do not wish
                to go into much detail on the subject at this time.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for supporting the project. The foundation is being disolved
                and the long-term of the project is that it will be a personal hobby
                project of mine. I have not quit the project and I do intend on returning
                here after my next court date. I am sorry if this news dissapoints anyone
                who believed in me.
                <br><br>
