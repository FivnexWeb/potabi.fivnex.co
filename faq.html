                        <strong>Why should I use Potabi over Linux?</strong><br>
                        While Linux is a fine substitute for MacOS and Windows 10, it does
                        come with its fair share of issues. We have a section on this page
                        on <a href="#why-not-linux" class="has-text-info">why not Linux?</a>

                        <strong>What is Potabi based on?</strong><br>
                        Potabi is a derivative of a sister project, CoreNGS, which is a 
                        derivative of FreeBSD, as well as componants from other BSD-branded 
                        systems, and Illumos.

                        <strong>Why not fork [this system]?</strong><br>
                        The current BSD's, Illumos, and other foundations honestly just
                        kinda suck for a variety of reasons. So we aim to be independent.
                        They are good people, just bad foundations.

                        <strong>Does package management suck?</strong><br>
                        The short answer is we try to make it work as best as we can. We
                        are concerned with package stability and sustainability. We want
                        package maintence to be as painless as possible.

                        Yes, we are working on a mobile version of Potabi. Fun history
                        fact, the Potabi project started with the intent of building a
                        FreeBSD-based mobile OS!

                        <strong>What makes Potabi different?</strong><br>
                        Understanding of importance of stability and design. The Potabi
                        Foundation actively owns and manages the project, and not just
                        "supports" it with minimal control.

                        <strong>Are donations to Potabi tax exempt?</strong><br>
                        As of now, no. The reason being the tax-exemption status rules
                        are hard to navigate. While we are a "non-profit", we aren't
                        tax-exempt, and may never be. Thanks, complex tax laws.

                        <strong>Is Potabi a commercial project?</strong><br>
                        As of now, no. The Potabi Foundation might consider reforming
                        as a for-profit organization to better support the project, but
                        right now that is undecided.

                        <strong>Is Potabi one of those "safe-spaces"?</strong><br>
                        Yes. We believe that users of our system shouldn't be scared
                        for being human. Harassment, racism, homophobia, transphobia,
                        bullying, etc are unacceptable in the community.

                        MATE is the desktop environment we are using as the system starts 
                        to mature. MATE will eventually be replaced with an in-houce desktop
                        environment solution.

                        Yes. While the technology is buggy, and still needs a lot of work,
                        it is the current next display server standard, and it is licensed 
                        under MIT, meaning no viral license concerns.

                        <strong>Is Potabi open-source?</strong><br>
                        The core of Potabi is open-source, and we plan on supporting open-source
                        only versions of the system. However, we also plan to support proprietary
                        software in later versions of the operating system.

            <h1 class="title">Why Not Linux</h1>
            <p>While Linux, and the variety of distributions are wonderful in their own right, they do come with borderline unfixable problems. A major issue is with Linux's viral license issues. GNU's General Public License is known as a viral license, which essentially means it affects software that works with it, making a lot of proprietary or "non-free" software use within the operating system questionable at best. This licensing problem makes a lot of companies - most notably Nvidia - more hesitent to support Linux, whether it'd be in software, drivers, etc.</p>
            <p>Potabi solves this issue by using non-viral open-source licenses, that better allow developers to continue using their license model of choice. While Linux software support is always improving, there are other conserns of note.</p>
            <p>A major point brought up by Bryan Lunduke in <a class="has-text-info" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtJ9T_IJOPE" target="_blank">Linux Sucks 2021</a> is that Linux is currently reaching a point of unsustainability. A core focus of Potabi is to focus on sustainability over new features and ideas. We have even started the <a href="https://corengs.github.io" class="has-text-info" target="_blank">CoreNGS Project</a>, which is essentially a replacement to FreeBSD - our original base) that is designed for sustainable development, even by splitting up directories to make sure each section can be maintained independently from the rest of the source, letting developers focus on what needs to happen, and less so on where to find it. We also are working on strict documentation rules, where everything and every tiny error message will have to meet a certain standard, as terrible error messages (for example <code>Unknown number of nodes detected</code>, like thanks, really helps the debugging process).</p>
            <p>Potabi aims to be a supportive ecosystem, that allows the best of open-source to work with - not against - the big names in proprietary software. Focusing on dependability, maintainability, simplicity, and sane structure are the core pillars of Potabi that Linux doesn't fufil.</p>
